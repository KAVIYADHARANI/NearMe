Southern Railway Headquarters Hospital, also known as the Perambur railway hospital, is a 500-bed hospital of the Southern Railway located in Ayanavaram, Chennai.
It is spread across a land measuring 15 acres (6.1 ha) and was established during the British rule in India.
The hospital has specialized in 15 basic disciplines and super-specialized in 3 disciplines. 
The National Board of Examination (NBE) has accredited the hospital for recognition in postgraduate training. 
The hospital has also been accredited by international institutions such as Royal College of Surgeons for imparting training in PG courses. 
It is also an approved institution for training nurses.
The hospital was established chiefly to serve the employees of the Indian Railways. 
The hospital, however, caters to general public as well at a low cost. 
The hospital is a national referral centre for cardiology and cardiovascular surgery for the Indian Railways.
The hospital was established in the British era. 
The need to build a separate hospital for the needs of the railway employees was felt in 1925 by the then chief medical officer of the Madras and Southern Mahratta (MSM) Railway, Maj. G. J. Cruikshank. 
In 1928, a 40-bed hospital was established for the MSM Railway employees in Perambur with a senior surgeon, 4 assistants and 12 nurses. 
In its initial days, the hospital primarily served the needs of the residents of the railway colony and the employees of the railway workshops. 
By 1930, the bed count of the hospital was increased to 50 besides additional facilities such as an operation theatre, x-ray centre, laboratory and out-patient servicesÂ department.
